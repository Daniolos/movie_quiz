# Movie Quiz

This project has scripts for getting movie details, generating imdb api responses and executing the name giving movie_quiz.py


## movie_quiz

The movie quiz chooses a random movie by accessing the ID_BY_MOVIE dictionary from the constants. The dictionary can be easily adjusted by commenting out lines with unwanted movies. 

After the movie was chosen, the imdb api is accessed to get a response with all keywords of the movie (and more). However this can be bypassed by using already accessed responses from the `respsonses` folder, which were generated by the `response_generator`.

**Note**: The `API_ACCESS` needs to be set accordingly

run the movie quiz by writing 

`python movie_quiz.py`

to the command line.

In the `constants.py` there are a lot of options including language options, typing speeds and more

## .env

create a .env file and enter the api key which can be acquired at https://rapidapi.com/hub

insert the api key together with this line

`X_RAPID_API_KEY=<api_key>`

**note**: this is not necessary, if the constant `API_ACCESS` is set to False

## venv

create a virtual environment using

`python3 -m venv movi_env`,

activate the venv using

`.  movie_env/bin/activate`

and deactivate using

`deactivate`

in the console.

To install all needed requirments use

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## coverage

To create a coverage report write

`coverage run -m pytest`

in the console followed by

`coverage html`.

Then open the index.html inside the htmlcov folder
